                    <p id="p-text-1">Finding myself writing and learning code is something that would've never crossed
                        my mind 4 years ago. I initially found myself having a passion for video editing and wanting to
                        work within the film industry. It turns out that industry didn't fit my personality, I loved the
                        idea of creating something, yet I saw how everything worked on the higher level and it wasn't
                        for me. I felt lost for such a long time, I knew I wanted to be a creator, I wanted to be known
                        for my work and grow my skillset. I felt lost for such a long time until I came across software
                        engineering.</p>
